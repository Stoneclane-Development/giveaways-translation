# GiveAways | Translation

## I want to add translation to the site! 

Congratulations, you want to translate with us? then choose a language and pull request. Do not forget to pay attention to spelling rules and not to be meaningless while translating. remember that once your translation is finished and accepted, it will be published on `giveaways-bot.com`. so don't forget to pay attention to this error. When you submit, we will check and if appropriate we will ask you for your discord id, if you have it, your role will be handed over. And your language will be added in about 1 hour after your discord ID is requested.
